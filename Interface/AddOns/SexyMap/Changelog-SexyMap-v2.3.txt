funkydude:
	- tweaks
	- Buttons: Remove some custom minimap icon handling code.
	- Shove the Minimap into the FRAMELOCK_STATES.PETBATTLES global table so that it's hidden during a pet battle, it wasn't being hidden due to being re-parented to UIParent, so the MinimapCluster :Hide call that Blizz does wouldn't cover it.
	- Buttons: more addon buttons
	- BorderPresets: Add new preset, Space by Ruka.
	- Buttons: Add a border around the world map button and tweak it a little to make it blend in with other icons.
	- Borders: Don't set the old pixelated circular mask when clearing all borders.
	- Buttons: Support more addon buttons.
	- Buttons: more addon buttons
	- Buttons: Remove the Atlas-specific button handling code as the author has thankfully moved to using LibDBIcon instead of using a button on a frame on the map.
