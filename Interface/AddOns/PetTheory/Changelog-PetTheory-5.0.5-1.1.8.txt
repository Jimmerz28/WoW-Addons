--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- FloatingBattlePetTooltip doesn't have an info_line (yet).
	- More loading changes, to prevent errors.
	- Don't just hide the PetJournalFilterButton and PetJournalListScrollFrame - completely remove their anchors as well so they cannot possibly show.
	- Handle edge-case where zone name is nil (likely before the player is completely in the game) and added matching against the sub zone as well.
	- Stop dynamically setting the anchors for BattlePetTooltip.info_line - they're always the same.
